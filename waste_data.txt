# Smart Waste Monitoring System - Data Log and Methodology

## 1. SENSOR SETUP AND MEASUREMENT METHOD

- **Sensor Used:** HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- **Controller:** NodeMCU (ESP8266)  
- **Measurement Principle:**  
  Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2  

- **Dustbin Height:** 40 cm (empty)  
- **Waste Threshold:** 75% (Alert triggered at ~30 cm filled)  

Sensor is mounted on the lid; it measures distance from sensor to waste surface.

## 2. HOW LEVEL IS CALCULATED

**Formula:**  
Distance_to_waste = Sensor Reading (in cm)  
Level (%) = ((Dustbin_Height - Distance_to_waste) / Dustbin_Height) × 100  

**Example Calculation:**  
- Sensor Reading = 5.2 cm  
- Level = ((40 - 5.2) / 40) × 100 = **87.0%**

## 3. SAMPLE DATA (From Real-Time Readings)

- **DateTime (UTC):** 2025-04-17 05:51:39  
- **Sensor Reading:** 4.4 cm  
- **Calculated Level:** 89.00%  
- **Alert Triggered:** YES (Threshold = 75%)

- **DateTime (UTC):** 2025-04-17 05:53:00  
- **Sensor Reading:** 5.2 cm  
- **Calculated Level:** 87.00%  
- **Displayed on:** Ubidots Dashboard

## 4. ACCURACY DETERMINATION

We tested 10 real-time readings at various fill levels (0% to 100%).

### Sample Test Comparison:

| **Test No.** | **Actual Fill Level**  | **Sensor-Based Reading**  | **Error (%)** |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 1            | 20%                    | 24%                       | 4.0%          |
| 2            | 40%                    | 44.5%                     | 4.5%          |
| 3            | 60%                    | 65%                       | 5.0%          |
| 4            | 80%                    | 76%                       | 4.0%          |
| 5            | 100%                   | 92%                       | 8.0%          |
| 6            | 70%                    | 67.2%                     | 2.8%          |
| 7            | 30%                    | 33.9%                     | 3.9%          |
| 8            | 90%                    | 86%                       | 4.0%          |
| 9            | 50%                    | 56%                       | 6.0%          |
| 10           | 10%                    | 15%                       | 5.0%          |

- **Average Error:** ~4.72%  
- **Final Reported Accuracy:** **~95%**

> This accuracy reflects slight deviations due to real-world conditions like ambient noise, irregular surfaces, and sensor calibration.
